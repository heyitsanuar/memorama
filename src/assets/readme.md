## Memory Game (Memorama)

Write a simple memory game for two players, the requirements are the followings:

1. Input the name for Player 1 and Player 2
2. A set of 9 pairs of cards will be scrambled and then displayed upside down (22 cards in total)
3. The players will start taking turns to pick cards, each player will be able to pick up 2 cards: if both cards match, the cards will be removed from the board and the player will score a point and the player will be able to continue picking cards. If the cards do not match, the cards will be flipped again upside down and it will be the 2nd player's turn.
4. Each player's score must be displayed on screen and updated when a player score a point.
5. The player with more points will win the game (display a message or something indicating the winner).
6. Give an option to restart the game.



***Use your imagination***
You can use whatever front end technology you feel more comfortable with, knockoutjs usage would give you extra points.
Cheers and good luck
